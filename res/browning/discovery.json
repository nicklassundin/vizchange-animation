Now the water has begun browning, too!\n\n- Let’s dive in, and explore the carbon cycle!\n- It has multiple steps that I repeat over and over\n- Sedimentation : As I sink into the water, I bring outside carbon with me—like little leaves and sticks that were stuck to my body before I jumped in!\n- Burial : I take a little break at the bottom, enjoying the view.\n-Decomposition: Then I go back up for air, but usually leave some carbon behind. So I gather some more, and I’m ready for another jump!"

In browning lakes, populations of organisms that need sunlight to survive, like algae and aquatic plants, are dwindling. This makes it hard for fish to eat, and hide from predators. Like humans, fish can only thrive under certain conditions. (For example, they need sufficient oxygen, safe temperatures, and abundant food.) But just like us, fish have unique tastes and sensibilities. The lake has recently become home to fish species that enjoy nutrient-rich environments, and recently moved in from elsewhere. (Maybe they migrated toward this newly carbon-heavy body of water on their own, or perhaps they were released into the water by humans, for fishing purposes.) Other fish are threatened by their new world—all of a sudden, the lake too warm for them and their eggs to survive, and they struggle to find food in the dark. They might start dying off, or migrating elsewhere, as a result."

Fish are the lake residents with which we humans are most familiar \n- Be it swimming for fun, or fishing to feast, we encounter them a lot. \n- But as lake water gets browner and warmer, lakes’ ice cover changes.\n- So our winter activities like skating or skiing are impacted, too!
